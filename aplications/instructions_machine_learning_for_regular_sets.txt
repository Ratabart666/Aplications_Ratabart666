For know more of the math and the code go to: https://github.com/Learning-regular-sets-project/Learning-regular-sets

Example:

The dfa that defines the oracle is:

dfa = DFA(
    states={'q0', 'q1', 'q2','q3','q4','q5'},
    input_symbols={'0', '1'},
    transitions={
        'q0': {'0': 'q2', '1': 'q1'},
        'q1': {'0': 'q2', '1': 'q1'},
        'q2': {'0': 'q4', '1': 'q3'},
        'q3': {'0': 'q4', '1': 'q3'},
        'q4': {'0': 'q5', '1': 'q4'},
        'q5': {'0': 'q5', '1': 'q5'}, 
    },
    initial_state='q0',
    final_states={'q5'}

In the next example with put the information for the aplication

Please put the states(separate by comas) of the dfa that recognizes the unkown lenguajes: 0,1,2,3,4,5
Please put the initial states: 0
Please put the final states(separate by comas): 5
Please first put the state and the transition funtion asociated, when finished put Break(in the states and
for break the loop)
Please put the state: 0
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:2
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:1
Please put the state: 1
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:2
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:1
Please put the state: 2
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:4
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:3
Please put the state: 3
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:4
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:3
Please put the state: 4
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:5
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:4
Please put the state: 5
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 0:5
Please put the state to which the state already entered passes when reading 1:5
Please put the state: Break
({'Q': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'q0': 0, 'F': [3], 'd': {0: {'0': 1, '1': 0}, 1: {'0': 2, '1': 1}, 2: {'0': 3, '1': 2}, 3: {'0': 3, '1': 3}}})
